## cel-convert will conver any running (manjaro atm) machine to one that runs xfce
## with kwin and cairo dock using some fancy configs. This is done by downloading
## all programs required to have a nice working setup with the package manager.
## This comes by default with base, base-devel and git. It does not modify currently
## installed versions of what you had installed before. It will only Download and not
## perform removals at this time.
## This changes some desktop files so they will work with this spin, This means it may
## break functionality while running each of the seperate desktop environments.

## this is not completed code. Use at your own risk. This will probably work with manjaro :)
